Another simple dice game of my series of android apps


Use git clone to download the project and open with Android Studio.

Play Instructions:
1. Click on the dice image to start your game.
2. Your dice will give you a number which would be a sum of two randomly generated number within 1-6.
3. You win if your dicesum is either 7 or 11.
4. You lose if dicesum is 3 or 12 or 2 .
5. Any other number you are allowed to proceed in the game, click the image of dice again.
6. If your second roll dicesum is equal to your first roll dice sum then you win! if not you are allowed to proceed unless your second roll is equal to 7 in which case you lose.



Enjoy !
